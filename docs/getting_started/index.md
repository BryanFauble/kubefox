# Overview

We're just beginning to build out the Getting Started section.

In the [Tutorials](./tutorials/index.md) section, we have a few things:

### [Quickstart](./tutorials/quickstart.md)

There's the [Quickstart](./tutorials/quickstart.md), which walks you
through the process of getting KubeFox running in either kind or Azure, and
gives you and introduction to some of its powerful features.  

### [Hasura](./tutorials/hasura.md)

We're also building out an Hasura Tutorial.  The piece we have here today
gets a kind cluster ready for the March 13th LiveStream we're doing with CNCF.

### [fox CLI](./install_fox_cli.md)

The fox CLI is our utility to enable you do quickly accomplish things - from
initializing a repository to use with KubeFox, to deploying and releasing
applications.
