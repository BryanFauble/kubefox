# Dynamic Routing and Guaranteed Delivery

KubeFox can achieve the capabilities described in [Virtual
Environments](virtual_environments.md) and [Versioned
Deployments](versioned_deployments.md) because it dynamically routes requests at
runtime.

When requests originate - [Genesis Events](index.md#genesis-event) in
KubeFox â€“ metadata is associated with them that informs the KubeFox runtime how
the requests should be routed. This occurs not only at origination time, but
throughout the System and for all components that are part of that System. In so
doing, KubeFox can guarantee delivery of requests to the correct version of each
component, irrespective of the number of versions of that component that may be
running.
